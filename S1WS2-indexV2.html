		<h2>Lesson 1: Basics to Web and HTML</h2>
		<div class = "Concept">
      		<h3>The Web</h3>
      		<div class = "Supporting-Info">
        		The web is a collection of HTML documents. Hyperlinks connect all the HTML documents together creating a web like structure. There are about 30 billion web pages.
      		</div>
      	</div>
      	<div class = "Concept">
       		<h3>HTML</h3>
       		<div class = "Supporting-Info">
	        	This stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is made up of text, markup, references to other documens (for example pictures and videos) and links to other pages.
	      	</div>
	      		<div class = "Example">
           			<h4>Markup</h4>
           			<div class = "Example Types">
            			The following are examples of different types of markup:
            			<ul>
            			<li><em>Tags</em> = composed of the name of the element, surrounded by angle brackets. An end tag also has a slash after the opening angle bracket, to distinguish it from the start tag.</li>
            			<li><em>Elements</em> = The contents that sits between tags.</li>
            			<li><em>Attributes</em> = are used inside some tags like the Anchor tag < a>. the attribute in this case is an href. Example = < a href = "www.reddit.com"> derp < /a></li>
            			<li><em>Images</em> = image files. For example < img> or < img src = "url" alt = "txt"> (This is for broken link messages)</li>
            			<li><em>Line Breaks</em> = these are carriage returns. For Example < br> (line break) or < p> (paragraph)</li>
            			<li><em>Inline vs Block</em> = These are the two types of breaks. < br> is inline and < p> is block.  Inlines are just lines of text whereas blocks, create a block of extra pixel space around the line.</li>
            			</ul>
        			</div>
      			</div>

    	<h2>Lesson2: Creating a Structured Document</h2>
    	<div class = "Concept">
      		<h3>HTML</h3>
      		<div class = "Supporting-Info">
         		HTML controls the "structure" of a web page. It is the language of the Internet. Tags are the words.  These tags form a tree like structure.  The tags can have attributes with values.
      		</div>
  		</div>
  		<div class = "Concept">
      		<h3>CSS</h3>
      		<div class = "Supporting-Info">
         		Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to control the "style" of a page (how it looks). It uses syntax and rules to define styles.
         	</div>
     	</div>
     	<div class = "Concept">
      		<h3>DOM</h3>
      		<div class = "Supporting-Info">
         		Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree like structure found in HTML.
     		</div>
  		</div>

    	<h2>Lesson 3:HTML, CSS and DOM</h2>
    	<div class = "Concept">
      		<h3>CSS Sumamry and Reference</h3>
      		<div class = "Supporting-Info">
        		There are 3 methods for including CSS Styling on a web page.<br>
		        <b>Method 1:</b> Write CSS in the < head> of your HTML
        		<p class ="indent">* This is good for small projects</p>
         		<b>Method 2:</b> Link your HTML to a separate CSS file
        		<p class ="indent">* This let's you stay more organized on larger projects.</p>
		        <b>Method 1:</b> Write CSS in the < head> of your HTML
        		<p class ="indent">* This is generally a very bad idea because it leads to lots of repeated code.</p>
    		</div>
  		</div>
  		<div class = "Concept">
      		<h3>Code, Test, Refine</h3>
      		<div class = "Supporting-Info">
      			<ol>
         			<li>Look for natural boxes</li>
         			<li>Look for repeated styles and semantic elements</li>
          			<li>Write your HTML</li>
          			<li>Apply styles (from biggest to smalles)</li>
          			<li>Fix things</li>
        		</ol>
      		</div>

  			<h3>Personal Thoughts and Notes</h3>
  			<div class = "Supporting-Info">
				<p>I studied this section 2 to 3 times over.  I wasn't noticing the instructor notes at the bottom of the screen because my screen was too small to see them.  Once I noticed the notes, the videos were easier to follow along with and make senese.  At times it is like drinking out of a firehose and it is difficult to take in all the informaiton (verbally and visually).</p>
